# Sign Language Alphabet Recognizer
This project is a sign language alphabet recognizer using Python, openCV and a convolutional neural network model for classification. 
The goal of this project is to build a neural network which can identify the alphabet of the American Sign Language (ASL) and translate it into text and voice.

## Dataset
The primary source of data for this project was the compiled dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ayuraj/american-sign-language-dataset).
The dataset is comprised of 18,200 images which are 200x200 pixels. There are 26 total classes, each with 700 images, 26 for the
letters A-Z.
